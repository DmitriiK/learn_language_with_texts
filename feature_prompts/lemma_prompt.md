in the main page, index.html, neeed to add checkbox that would define if lemmatization is needed.
If it checked, 
 - for web output format in the result_render.js system should request endpoint to get lemmas for the text and add it to the html as a table with lemmas in the bottom.
 - for json format it should open the result as  raw json in the separate page.
